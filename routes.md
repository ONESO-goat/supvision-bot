# YTG API Reference

Base URL used throughout: `http://localhost:8000`
Adjust the host/port if your FastAPI server runs elsewhere. All request bodies are JSON unless noted (the `/scan` endpoint uses multipart form data for the image upload).

---

## `routes/session_routes.py` — Guardian Sessions

A **GuardianSession** is the live, per-user monitoring session — it holds the warning/timer state and pending points for one user under one Guardian.

### `GET /sessions/`
Lists all sessions.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions/
```

## `POST /{guardian_id}/on`
Turns on the guardian, which automatically creates sessions for the users who are connected with the guardian

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/GUARDIAN_ID_HERE/on
```


## `POST /{guardian_id}/off`
Turns off the guardian, which deletes all concurring sessions under the guardian/ 

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/GUARDIAN_ID_HERE/off
```

### `POST /sessions/create`
Gets the existing session for a user+Guardian pair, or creates one if it doesn't exist yet. Call this once when the extension/app starts watching.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "USER_ID_HERE",
    "guardian_id": "GUARDIAN_ID_HERE"
  }'
```

### `GET /sessions/{session_id}`
Fetches a single session by ID — use this for cheap polling of current state (warning active? timer running?) without uploading a new screenshot.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions/SESSION_ID_HERE
```

### `GET /sessions/guardian/{guardian_id}`
Lists all active sessions under a given Guardian (e.g. all currently-monitored dependents at once, for a parent dashboard).

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions/guardian/GUARDIAN_ID_HERE
```

### `DELETE /sessions/{session_id}`
Deletes/ends a session (e.g. on logout or after a period of inactivity).

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/sessions/SESSION_ID_HERE
```

### `POST /sessions/{session_id}/scan` — core monitoring loop
Uploads a screenshot for classification. This is the endpoint the extension calls every 5-10s. **Multipart form data, not JSON** — the image goes in a `file` field.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/SESSION_ID_HERE/scan \
  -F "file=@/path/to/screenshot.png"
```

Response shape:
```json
{
  "flagged": true,
  "description": "A social media post referencing restricted content.",
  "warning_active": true,
  "points_awarded": false
}
```

### `POST /sessions/{session_id}/events`
Manually adds an event to a session's event log (mostly for testing — in normal flow, `/scan` adds events automatically when content is flagged).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/SESSION_ID_HERE/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Test event for manual QA",
    "time_duration": 180
  }'
```
`time_duration` is optional — omit it to get a randomized 140-300s duration.

### `POST /sessions/{session_id}/flush`
Converts all pending events on a session into permanent `GuardianReport`s (visible to the owner) and clears the session's event log. Call this when the guardian views their alert inbox, or periodically.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/SESSION_ID_HERE/flush
```

## `routes/gamify_routes.py` — Points & Rewards

### `PUT /gameify/users/{user_id}/points`

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 500
  }'
```

### `POST /gameify/users/{user_id}/points/add`
Adds points to a user's balance (e.g. after a successful avoidance timer completes).

```bash

Deducts points from a user's balance.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/gameify/users/USER_ID_HERE/points/remove \

    "amount": 50
  }'
```

```

### `GET /gameify/rewards/{reward_id}`

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/gameify/rewards/REWARD_ID_HERE
```

### `POST /gameify/rewards`
Creates a new reward in the store (admin/seeding endpoint).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/gameify/rewards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Dunkin Gift Card",
    "reward_amount": 20,

    "reward_type": "gift_card"
  }'

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reward_id": "REWARD_ID_HERE"
  }'
```

### `POST /gameify/users/{user_id}/rewards/refund`
Refunds a previously purchased reward back to points (partial refund, per the `Gameify.refund_reward` logic).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/gameify/users/USER_ID_HERE/rewards/refund \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reward_id": "REWARD_ID_HERE"
  }'
```

## Suggested end-to-end test sequence

A realistic order to exercise the whole system manually:

1. `POST /auth/signup` → get a `user_id`
2. `POST /guardians/` (with `owner_id` = that user) → get a `guardian_id`
3. `POST /guardians/{guardian_id}/connections/add` → connect a second user as `"offspring"` if testing a family flow
4. `PATCH /guardians/{guardian_id}/settings/update` → set strictness/messages/points penalty check

current settings, its value, and description on its usage:
    *   strictness (string): How strict the agent should be with its responses and points system
        class StrictnessLevel(Enum):
            WEAK = "weak"
            NORMAL = "normal"
            HARSH = "harsh"

    *   language (string): Field(default=AvailableLanguages.ENGLISH.value), available languages
        class AvailableLanguages(Enum):
            ENGLISH = "en"
            SPANISH = "es"
            FRENCH = "fr"
            GERMAN = "de"
            ITALIAN = "it"
            PORTUGUESE = "pt"
            DUTCH = "nl"
            RUSSIAN = "ru"
            CHINESE = "zh"
            JAPANESE = "ja"
            KOREAN = "ko"

    *   custom_warning_messages (dict): 
        Two values 
        ```json
        {"warning": "warning message for content that deems harmful by owner demands", 
        "applause": "Message to applause the user if they listened to the warning"}
        ```
        
        The owner can edit the messages as an act of encoragement

    *   points_loss_enabled (boolean): whether the user loses points or not

    *   base_points_lost (number): The owner has control on how many points are lost

5. `POST /{guardian_id}/restrictions/add` → The owner sets restrictions for the guardian to detect
6. `POST /sessions/{guardian_id}/on` → start the agent, this creates sessions for users who are connected with the guradian

7. `POST /sessions/{session_id}/scan` → upload a test screenshot, see if it flags
8. `GET /sessions/{session_id}` → poll state
9. `POST /sessions/{session_id}/flush` → push any logged events into reports
10. `GET /guardians/reports/{guardian_id}` → confirm the report shows up
11. `POST /gameify/users/{user_id}/points/add` → simulate a completed avoidance timer. If points penalty check is true in guardian settings and the user is still viewing restricted content, the user loses point with the route `POST /gameify/users/{user_id}/points/remove`
12. `GET /gameify/rewards` → browse the store
13. `POST /gameify/users/{user_id}/rewards/buy` → spend points
14. `POST /sessions/{guardian_id}/off` → A guardian can stay on for long periods, but if the owner decides its the end of the cycle they can turn off the guardian which deletes all concurring sessions
